The solution often involves carefully examining the error messages provided during the build process.  These messages often pinpoint the exact dependency or configuration causing the problem.  Here's a general strategy:

1. **Update Dependencies:** Ensure your project's `package.json` contains the latest compatible versions of Expo and its dependencies.  Use `npm update` or `yarn upgrade` to update to the latest stable versions.
2. **Check `gradle-wrapper.properties`:** Verify that the distributionUrl in the `gradle-wrapper.properties` file (located in the `android` directory) points to a compatible and updated Gradle version.  Consider using the latest recommended version for the AGP version you're using.
3. **Review `build.gradle` Files:** Examine both the `build.gradle` (Project: app) and `build.gradle` (Module: app) files to ensure there aren't any conflicting dependencies or AGP version settings.  Pay close attention to the `dependencies` and `ext` blocks.
4. **Clean and Rebuild:** After making any changes to dependencies or configurations, always clean the project and rebuild it using `expo prebuild` and then `expo build:android`. This helps clear cached files and ensures that the changes are reflected in the build process. 
5. **Check for Expo SDK Compatibility:** Make sure the version of the Expo SDK you're using is compatible with the latest version of the Android Gradle Plugin.  Consult the official Expo documentation for compatibility information.
6. **Invalidate Caches/Restart:** If all else fails, try invalidating the caches of your IDE (e.g., Android Studio, IntelliJ) and restarting it.  Sometimes the IDE can cache outdated information that causes build issues.
